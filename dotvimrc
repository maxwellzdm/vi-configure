" The default for 'backspace' is very confusing to new users, so change it to a
" more sensible value.  Add "set backspace&" to your ~/.vimrc to reset it.

" Disable localized menus for now since only some items are translated (e.g.
" the entire MacVim menu is set up in a nib file which currently only is
" translated to English)
